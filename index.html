                <h2>About Ramadan Kareem</h2>
                <p>
                    Ramadan is a holy month of worship, study of the Quran, prayer, and fasting. Ramadan occurs during
                    the month in which Muslims believe the Quran began to be revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. It is a
                    joyous celebration for Muslims. Fasting is one of the Five Pillars of Islam.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this month, Muslims observe a strict fast from dawn until sunset. They are not allowed to eat
                    or drink (even water) during daylight hours. Fasting is a private act of worship bringing about
                    nearness to God, as well as a form of spiritual discipline and a means to empathize with those less
                    fortunate.</p>

                <p>
                    It is the month in which it is believed that the Holy Qur'an was sent down from heaven "as a
                    guidance for men and women, a declaration of direction, and a means of salvation." During this
                    month, Muslims observe a strict fast from dawn until sunset.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Muslims believe that in A.D. 610, the angel Gabriel appeared to Prophet Muhammad and revealed to him
                    the Quran, the Islamic holy book.

                            The Quran was undoubtedly revealed during Ramadan as clear and indisputable guidance for mankind, explicitly distinguishing between right and wrong.  Ramadan is a holy month of worship, study of the Quran, prayer, and fasting. Ramadan occurs during</p>

                            During Ramadan, Muslims fast to practice self-discipline, self-control, and empathy for those who are less fortunate. Fasting also instills compassion for the food-insecure poor, encouraging charity (zakat) and generosity. </p>

                            The fast is broken at the end of the day with prayer and a festive meal called an iftar. It is customary to visit family and friends following the iftar. During Ramadan, many Muslims go to the mosque and spend several hours praying. </p>
